**Keylogger Project**: This simple keylogger, written in Python, captures keystrokes and logs them to a file named `key_log.txt`, intended for educational purposes only. To get started, ensure you have Python 3 installed and the `pynput` library, which can be installed via `pip install pynput`. Save the provided code as `keylogger.py`, and run the script using `python keylogger.py` in your terminal. The program creates `key_log.txt` in the same directory, where keystrokes will be logged in real-time until you press the `Esc` key to stop it. Always obtain explicit permission before using this software on any system, as unauthorized keylogging can violate privacy laws.
